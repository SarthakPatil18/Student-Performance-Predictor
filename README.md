# 📊 Student Performance Predictor (ML Project)(Beginner)

This machine learning project uses linear regression to predict students' math scores based on various features like gender, parental education, test preparation, and other exam scores.

## 📌 What I Learned
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Label encoding categorical variables
- Train/Test split
- Linear regression with `scikit-learn`
- Visualizing predictions and residuals
- Evaluating model using R² Score

## 🧠 Model Used
- Linear Regression (R² Score: **0.88**)

## 🔍 Dataset
- Source: [StudentsPerformance.csv](./StudentsPerformance.csv)
- Features used:
  - Gender
  - Race/Ethnicity
  - Parental level of education
  - Lunch
  - Test preparation course
  - Reading and Writing scores

## 📊 Visuals
- Actual vs Predicted Plot
- Residual (Error) Distribution Plot

## 🛠️ Tools
- Python
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
